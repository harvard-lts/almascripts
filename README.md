# almascripts
A subset of the scripts written by the Library Technology Services group (LTS) at Harvard to work with the Alma library management system. More scripts might be shared as time permits.

Before using these scripts, after cloning the repository, set-up the top-level configuration file. 
```
cd almascripts/conf
cp main.yaml_template main.yaml
```
And then fill in any parameters in main.yaml that you will be using.
